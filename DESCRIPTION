Description: 'Econometric Analysis of Panel Data' (ISBN 978-3-030-53952-8)
    provides up-to-date coverage of basic panel data techniques, illustrated
    with real economic applications and datasets. However, importing the
    original data from the book into R is not straightforward because
    some of the datasets are available in Microsoft Word format. I provide the
    datasets in tidy format, expecting that this will allow students to focus on
    the econometric techniques rather than on data wrangling.

## About

'Econometric Analysis of Panel Data' (ISBN 978-3-030-53952-8)
provides up-to-date coverage of basic panel data techniques, illustrated
with real economic applications and datasets. However, importing the
original data from the book into R is not straightforward because
some of the datasets are available in Microsoft Word format. I provide the
datasets in tidy format, expecting that this will allow students to focus on
the econometric techniques rather than on data wrangling.
